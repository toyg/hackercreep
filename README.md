Wat
----

While browsing Pinboard, if a page was posted to HN, 
it will report score and number of comments for that page, and link to relevant HN thread.
Otherwise, the link will take you to the (helpfully prefilled) HN submission form.

Feature requests welcome.

Supported Browsers
-------------------

* Chrome
* Firefox / Greasemonkey script
* Firefox / WebExtensions package 
(this is still a work in progress. At the moment it would only work in Developer and Nightly anyway)

Safari is not going to happen unless someone kindly donates towards an Apple developer subscription.
