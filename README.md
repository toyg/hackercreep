Wat
----

While browsing Pinboard, if a link was posted to HN, 
it will tell you score and number of comments, and link to the thread.
If the link has never been posted, the link will take you to the (helpfully
prefilled) submission form.

Feature requests welcome.

-------------------

* Chrome
* Firefox / Greasemonkey script

Safari is not going to happen unless someone kindly donates towards an Apple developer subscription.
