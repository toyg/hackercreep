*Integrating Pinboard and HackerNews to bring about Armageddon.*

Wat
----

While browsing Pinboard, if a page was posted to HN, 
it will report score and number of comments for that page, and link to relevant HN thread.
Otherwise, the link will take you to the (helpfully prefilled) HN submission form.

Feature requests welcome.
